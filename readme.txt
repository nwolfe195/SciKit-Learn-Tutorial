This is a multi purpose tutorial project intended to refamiliarize myself with a number of technologies.
Primarily, it is to refamiliarize myself with the Python module SciKit-Learn, while also reminding myself how to work with git based version control.
In addition, this coincides with my resetting my laptop to clear the junk, so it'll also be a bit of a fresh setup practice.
